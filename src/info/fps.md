The expression `1000 / 60` is calculating the time duration (in milliseconds) for a single frame when targeting **60 frames per second (FPS)**.

### Explanation:

- **FPS (Frames Per Second):** The number of frames displayed per second. In this case, 60 FPS means the screen refreshes 60 times in one second.
- **Milliseconds in a second:** There are 1000 milliseconds in one second.
- **Time per frame:** At 60 FPS, the time taken to render each frame is:
  \[
  \text{Time per frame} = \frac{\text{Milliseconds in one second}}{\text{FPS}} = \frac{1000}{60}
  \]
  This results in approximately `16.67 milliseconds` per frame.

### Why is this useful?

When designing animations, games, or visual effects in programming, maintaining a consistent frame rate is crucial for smooth visuals. By calculating `1000 / 60`, you know the **maximum time** you can spend rendering a single frame to stay within the 60 FPS target.

For example:

```javascript
const frameTime = 1000 / 60; // ~16.67 ms
```

This value (`16.67 ms`) can be used in timing loops, like:

- Ensuring rendering logic completes within this time.
- Synchronizing animations or game logic updates.
